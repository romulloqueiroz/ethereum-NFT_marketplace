### Ropsten has been deprecated, so it won't work! ðŸ˜±
### I have to update it but right now I'm feeling lazy. The code is still valid though.

  <h3>Instructions</h3>

  <p>
    To run the project, just install de dependencies and type 'yarn dev', just like any project in NextJs.
  </p>
  <p>
    To play with the project, you gonna need to have <a href='https://metamask.io/'>MetaMask</a> installed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once installed, just set it to the Ropsten network. Make sure you have some Ropsten ether on it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Please don't upload anything besides image urls. I haven't added validation yet, so it gonna break the website layout. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Please don't upload anything shameful. Once uploaded a picture to the blockchain it can't be removed, so I'm going to have to redeploy the contract.
  </p>

<p>Please feel free to take a look at the code, fork it, steal it, whatever.<br/></p>
